#### Contributing to Donkey - The Manifesto

As a modest programmer myself, I always disliked seeing rude and antagonistic comments from self-righteous people in response to tech questions in forums and servers. It's for this reason that I ask any and all contributers to be patient, encouraging, and open to anyone interested in contributing to this project. This is a fun and lighthearted project built by, and for, a community that does not take itself seriously. The more beginners that can contribute to this project, the better Donkey will become.
